# Chibi-like take on Frogger: an Udacity FEND Exercise submitted by Leroy
## How to run
This game was built using HTML5's canvas technology. Therefore, in order to run this game you will need to have a web browser which supports this technology on your computer. Most modern browsers today will do the job. You can check what browsers support canvas with this link (green means this version of browser supports it): [caniuse.com/#feat=canvas](https://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)

Once you have a supporting browser on your computer, follow these instructions:
1. Download/pull the files from this repository into a folder on your computer.
2. Double click/Open index.html with the supporting browser.

## How to play

1. Your character will immediately spawn, you can control it using the arrow keys.
2. Press "x" to change character.
3. If you happen to finish the game/get a game over press "z" to restart (the game will tell you this as well).

## Web console commands

These commands are only required if you wish to mess with the game's code for testing/just for fun. You can open the web console by pressing `CTRL+Shift+J`.

* `allEneies = []` will prevent enemies from moving and hurting player until they are renewed (e.g new stage).
